			<h2 class="pink">Dim Sum</h2>
			<p>
				Dim sum means ‘touch your heart’ and with as many as 150 items on a restaurant menu, and 2,000 in the entire range, it is a challenge to not find something you love. As Cantonese people tend to avoid fried foods early in the day, steamed dishes dominate most dim sum menus. There are also snack-sized portions of pan-fried, deep-fried, and baked served in bamboo containers, which are designed to be eaten communally and washed down with tea. Hence, going for dim sum is known as yum cha, which literally means ‘drinking tea.’ Usually a brunch or lunch affair, it is a common form of family, co-worker and other group get-togethers.

			<h2 class="red">Seafood</h2>
			<p>
				It’s fried, baked, steamed, grilled, sliced, diced and stuffed. More to the point, Hong Kong’s seafood is very fresh. So fresh, you can see it swimming minutes before it’s on your table. True to form, Asia’s world city also offers up seafood in a variety of dining experiences that range from cosmopolitan fusions that would impress the most jaded epicurean all the way down to the best-served-with-beer ‘sampan-style’ concoctions.
				For a truly enjoyable seafood feast, desert the downtown for a few hours and head for a seafood district. Here you will find rows of restaurants where you can pick your prey from an aquarium and eat it alfresco while enjoying picturesque sea views on a balmy Hong Kong evening.

			<h2 class="yellow">Char Siu</h2>
			<p>
			Char siu is a popular way to flavor and prepare barbecued pork in Cantonese cuisine. It is classified as a type of siu mei, Cantonese roasted meat. Char siu literally means "fork burn/roast" (siu being burn/roast and char being fork, both noun and verb) after the traditional cooking method for the dish: long strips of seasoned boneless pork are skewered with long forks and placed in a covered oven or over a fire. In Hong Kong, char siu is usually purchased from a siu mei establishment, which specializes in meat dishes—char siu pork, soy sauce chicken, white cut chicken, roasted goose, roasted pork, etc. These shops usually display the merchandise by hanging them in the window. As a result, char siu is often consumed alongside one of these other meat dishes when eaten as an independent lunch item on a per-person basis in a "rice box" meal. More commonly it is purchased whole or sliced and wrapped and taken home to be used in family meals either by itself or cooked into one of many vegetable or meat dishes which use char siu pork as an ingredient.
